# Please note that this project was coded exclusively in oTree 3.3.1, this is also the version of oTree which I 
# just used to test the task and ensure that it was working correctly.

# Numpy is also required, this project was coded using Numpy 1.20.1.

# The timer for the task is handeled in models.py, and is currently set to 180 seconds (3 minutes).

# Each correct answer provides the participant with +1 to the 'correct' variable, and each correct answer
# is worth 5 points.
